Welcome! I am a second year MSECE Student at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/), advised by Prof. [Yongxin Chen](https://yongxin.ae.gatech.edu/). Before coming to Georgia Tech, I obtained my Bachelor of Engineering in Ocean Engineering and Technology from [Zhejiang University (ZJU)](https://www.zju.edu.cn/).

My research focuses on stochastic motion planning and control under uncertainty, and I am also exploring machine learning methods for motion planning. More broadly, I am interested in the intersection of optimization and learning, with the goal of developing robust and intelligent robotic systems.
